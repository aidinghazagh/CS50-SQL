This repo is my Final project for the CS50 SQL course

DESIGN.md, which is a rigorous design document describing my database’s purpose, scope, entities, relationships, optimizations, and limitations.

schema.sql, which is an annotated set of CREATE TABLE, CREATE INDEX, CREATE VIEW, etc. statements that compose my database’s schema.

queries.sql, which is an annotated set of SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc. statements that users will commonly run on my database.
